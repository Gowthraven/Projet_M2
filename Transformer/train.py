"""
This file contains the training pipeline for a Transformer model specialized in
melody generation. It includes functions to calculate loss, perform training steps,
and orchestrate the training process over multiple epochs. The script also
demonstrates the use of the MelodyGenerator class to generate a melody after training.

The training process uses a custom implementation of the Transformer model,
defined in the 'transformer.py' module, and prepares data using the
MelodyPreprocessor class from 'melodypreprocessor.py'.

Global parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, and path to the dataset
are defined. The script supports dynamic padding of sequences and employs the
Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function for model training.

For simplicity's sake training does not deal with masking of padded values
in the encoder and decoder. Also, look-ahead masking is not implemented.
Both of these are left as an exercise for the student.

Key Functions:
- _calculate_loss_function: Computes the loss between actual and predicted sequences.
- _train_step: Executes a single training step, including forward pass and backpropagation.
- train: Runs the training loop over the entire dataset for a given number of epochs.
- _right_pad_sequence_once: Utility function for padding sequences.

The script concludes by instantiating the Transformer model, conducting the training,
and generating a sample melody using the trained model.
